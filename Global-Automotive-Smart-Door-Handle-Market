Consumer demand for luxury and convenience
The modern consumer wants his car to be more about luxury, comfort, and new technologies. Smart door handles, being sleek designs integrated into the car body, satisfy this demander. The convenience brought about by keyless entry and added security with biometric access make it very enticing for the high-end consumer, hence boosting market growth even further.

Market Segmentation

By Technology:
Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS): It allows the driver to enter and switch on the vehicle without the physical use of a key. PEPS finds increasing applications in its comfort and security features. This segment is finding fast growth in the market.
Biometric Systems: Fingerprint and face detection find increasing usage in smart door handles for added safety. Biometric systems will see wider applications in the near future.

Button-based systems: These are more simple systems in which the user has to push a button on the handle to gain access to the door. While they are not as advanced as the PEPS and biometric systems, they find application in middle-range cars.

# Based on Vehicle Type:
Passenger Vehicles: The largest segment in the market is passenger vehicles, as smart door handles are increasingly being installed, more so with luxury and premium models. This segment is growing based on the fact that the general consumers are more technology inclined and prefer vehicles considered to be higher in that order.

Commercial Vehicles: Commercial vehicles show a lower acceptance level, or the adoption rate is less for intelligent door handles compared to passenger vehicles; the integration of these features is growing for additional security in high-value transport vehicles.

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers): Most smart door handles are installed in a car as it is produced. OEMs play equally important roles because the best automotive producers cooperate with technology providers to give an automobile a thoroughly developed system of door handles.

Aftermarket: The aftermarket for smart car door handles is relatively smaller, but the same is getting momentum since, with tech-savvy consumers, they want more advanced features in their incumbent vehicles. The aftermarket segment is thus projected to grow on the same ground as more vehicles on the road are aging, and thus, the vehicle owners do not mind spending a little more to make its features even more up-to-date with time.
